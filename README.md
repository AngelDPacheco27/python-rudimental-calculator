Rudimental Python Calculator

A robust command-line interface (CLI) calculator built with Python that supports basic and advanced arithmetic operations. This project demonstrates clean functional programming, strict input validation, and loop-based logic for continuous calculations.

Features:

Comprehensive Operations: Supports Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Exponentiation, Modulus, and Floor Division.

Input Validation: Ensures the program doesn't crash by verifying that inputs are positive whole numbers and valid operation letters.

Zero-Division Protection: Includes a custom check to prevent mathematical errors when a user attempts to divide by zero.

State Persistence: Allows users to perform sequential operations on the previous result (e.g., 10 + 5 = 15 => 15 x 2 = 30).

User-Friendly Flow: Clear prompts and the ability to restart a fresh calculation or exit the program gracefully.

Tech Stack:
Language: Python 3.x

Environment: VS Code
